        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p><p>I like a lot of different kinds of music. There are just two genres I'm not too keen on which would be rap and country music.</p>

        <p>I like classical music especially composers like bethoveen and bach. I also like listening to music scores from movies. My favorite composers are Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman.</p>

        <p> My favorite music to listen to is indie and rock.
