        <p>My favorite painting is this one called Mountian Sound. It is the first mountian painting I ever did. I really love the nigt sky when stars can be seen so I'm attached to this painting the most.</p>

        <p> This is a graphite drawing of one of the bands I listen to called Greta Van Fleet. I'm not a fan of the finished product so I will just share one of the stages that I did like.
